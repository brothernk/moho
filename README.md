# NYTReact_App
NYT React App using MERN stack for HW16 UMN Coding Bootcamp

This application allows the user to search New York Times articles using search terms and date frames. Resulting found articles are shown, and the user has the option to save an article for later reference. Once saved, the user also has the option to delete the article from their saved database.

The application can be downloaded from GitHub and run on your personal computer. Before using, the user must run the following command in both their root directory and client directory. 
`
yarn install
`
After the dependencies are installed, the application can be run by entering 
`
yarn start
` 
in the home directory.
